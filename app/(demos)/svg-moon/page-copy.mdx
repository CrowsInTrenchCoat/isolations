# Moon Phase

A React component that draws an <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> path that illustrates a given phase of the moon.

<SvgArtboardControlled />

## Story

I wanted to build a simple web browser extension that diplayed the current phase of the moon when I opening a new tab. I decided to use the [Visual Crossing Weather Data & API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) which returns the data I need. Now all I needed to do was figure out how to draw a picture of the moon in a web browser at every possible phase. Fun!

The Visual Crossing API can be asked to return a `moonphase` property for each day in the result set. This value is a number from zero to one.
