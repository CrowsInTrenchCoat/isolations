## Description

A React component that draws an <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>
semicircle path at a given percentage.

## Appearance and Expectations

A retangular box divided into two sections should appear.

The larger section contains a transparent circle outlined with 50 dots equally spaced arond its circumference. A thin line extends vertically from the circle's midpoint to the uppermost dot.

The smaller section contains two linked form controls each of which enable the definition of an integer from zero to one hundred.

Changing the value of either input should result in a blue semicircle being drawn from the zero point to a point representative of the provide percentage in a clockwise direction.
