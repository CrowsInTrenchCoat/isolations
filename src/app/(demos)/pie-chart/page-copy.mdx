# Pie Chart

<Demo diameter={300} />

## Inspiration

Once upon a time, I was creating a teensy little app that would help me visualize information of some-sort and I wanted to include a pie chart. Many of the available options that I found were either part of large component libraries or included features that I really did not need. I just wanted something simple that only included an SVG circle. Maybe I could create my own?

This project lead me down a couple proverbial rabbit holes. But eventually I emerged unscathed and with a deeper understanding of SVG and React.

## Interface

I was inspired to create an interface that allowed me to work with two custom components `<PieChart />` and `<Slice />`.

- __`<PieChart>`__ - Responsible for rendering the `<svg>` element.
- __`<Slice>`__ - Defines data for each slice of the pie.

With these pieces in place, I should be able to just render a simple pie chart wherever I need one like this:

```tsx
<PieChart diameter={300} >
  <Slice value={1} fill="black" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="hotpink" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="black" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="hotpink" />
</PieChart>
```

My first implementation involved writing a process in `<PieChart>` that looped over `props.children`, read the data from each `<Slice>`, and drew an SVG shape element for each slice.

And all was good in the world.

until...

## Issue 1: Dynamic Data

I attempted to create a custom component that defined an array for slice configuration and then rendered `<Slice>` components inside of `<PieChart>`. This is a very common pattern in React development that is critcal to support in my opinion.

Here's what my new implementation looks like:

```tsx
function MyPieChart () {
  const slices = [
    { value: 1, fill: 'black' },
    { value: 1, fill: 'hotpink' },
    { value: 1, fill: 'black' },
    { value: 1, fill: 'hotpink' },
  ]
  return (
    <PieChart diameter={300}>
      {slices.map((slice, index) => {
        return <Slice key={index} {...slice} />
      })}
    </PieChart>
  )
}
```

Unfortunately, no slices were drawn after I refactored my code.

Sadness.

## Issue #2: Accessibility

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element">SVG supports a plethora of elements</a>. Now, I could argue that *"retangles have no place in piecharts!"* or that *"I can't think of a valid use case for the inclusion of an elipse in this context"*. There all all sorts of excuse I could make to exclude a large portion of SVG elements from my component. It does not take any amounts of mental gymnastics and I could even find myself agreeing with most of these arguments.

That said, the `<svg>` element also supports [`<title>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/title) and [`<desc>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/desc) descendant elements which are used to provide text alternatives to accessible technology.

So I plugged these guys into my component like this:

```tsx
<PieChart diameter={300}>
  <title>Example piece chart</title>
  <desc>A circle divided equally into four quadrants...</desc>
  <Slice value={1} fill="black" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="hotpink" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="black" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="hotpink" />
</PieChart>
```

This time the slices did appear but the `<title>` and `<desc>` elements never rendered.

More sadness.

## Okay, computer. I can refactor...

My solution to issues number one and two involved creating 2 recursive reducers. One to calculate the sum of all slice values and another that converted instances of the `<Slice>` component into paths while perserving all other direct descendants of `props.children`.
