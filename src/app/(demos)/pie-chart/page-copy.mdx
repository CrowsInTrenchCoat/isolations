# Pie Chart

<Demo />

## Inspiration

Once upon a time, I was creating a teensy little app that would help me visualize information of some-sort and I wanted to include a pie chart. Unfortunately, I was unable to pin down a simple React component that did this for me.

## Interface

Here's the code that renders the pie chart in the demo above.

```tsx
<PieChart diameter={300} >
  <Slice value={1} fill="black" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="hotpink" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="black" />
  <Slice value={1} fill="hotpink" />
</PieChart>
```
