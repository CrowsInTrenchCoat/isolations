# Overflowing `<pre>` Element

I was creating a simple two column grid layout in HTML and CSS when I noticed that the contents of `<pre>` elements were causing the browser to render a horizontal scrollbar.

## Solution

Setting the `min-width` property of the grid item that contains the `<pre>` to zero is the solution that I have seen mentioned the most and it appears to work rather well for my purposes.

```scss
#template {
  display: grid;
  > * {
    min-width: 0;
  }
}
```
