# Nested Layouts in Next.js

The following error appeared in my browser's console:

```js
Warning: Extra attributes from the server: class
```

When I searched for potential causes online I found a lot of people reporting that their issue stemmed from a browser extension injecting a class on the body element.

In my case, this was not not issue.

I had *accidentally* copied and pasted the root layout file into a sub directory of `@/app` without altering the file to remove the `<html>` and `<body>` tags from the nested `layout.tsx`.

<FigureCode
  caption="An abbreviated representation of the structure of my app directory."
>
```txt
  ├── src
  └── app
      ├── (home)
      │   └── layout.js
      └── layout.js
```
</FigureCode>



My problem came from rendering two `<body>` elements on each page load.
