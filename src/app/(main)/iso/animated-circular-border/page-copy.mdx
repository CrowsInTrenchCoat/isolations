# Animated Circular Border

I came across [this short video](https://youtube.com/shorts/BiYBJ9PIbrw) that demonstates a process that creates a really nice animated border effect on circluar elements using CSS.

<FigureFile
  src="/isolations/html/animated-circular-border.html"
  width="500"
  height="700"
/>
