# Moon Phase

A React component that draws an <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr> path that illustrates a given phase of the moon.

<Demo diameter={300} />

## Backstory

I wanted to build a simple web browser extension that diplayed the current phase of the moon when I opened a new tab. I decided to use the [Visual Crossing Weather Data & API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/) to retreive daily moon data. Now all I needed to do was figure out how to draw a picture of the moon in a web browser at every possible phase. Fun!

Oh, wait! *...How do we even do that?!?!?!*

## Circle Structure

My design-brain informed me that I need to start with a circle composed of points placed at the top, right, bottom, and left-most ends of the circumference of a circle. Once these points exist, it should be pretty easy to connect them with cubic bezier curves. With a structure like this it should be possible to adjust the coordinates of the left or right points along with the handles of the top and bottom points to create the illusion of a shadowed moon.

<figure className="figure">
  <div className="figure-subject">
    <CubicCircle
      radius="300"
      fill={c.hotpink}
      stroke={c.black}
    />
  </div>
  <figcaption className="figure-caption">
    Illustration of a circle drawn with four cubic bezier curves.
  </figcaption>
</figure>


## Moonphase Property

The Visual Crossing API can be asked to return a `moonphase` property for each day in the result set. This value is a number from zero to one.


| Number    | Interval       | Name            |
| --------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| 0         | `[0.00, 0.00]` | New             |
| 0–0.25    | `(0.00, 0.25)` | Waxing Crescent |
| 0.25      | `[0.25, 0.25]` | First Quarter   |
| 0.25–0.50 | `(0.25, 0.50)` | Waxing Gibbous  |
| 0.50      | `[0.50, 0.50]` | Full            |
| 0.50–0.75 | `(0.50, 0.75)` | Waning Gibbous  |
| 0.75      | `[0.75, 0.75]` | Last Quarter    |
| 0.75–1.00 | `(0.75, 1.00)` | Waning Crescent |
| 1.00      | `[1.00, 1.00]` | New             |
