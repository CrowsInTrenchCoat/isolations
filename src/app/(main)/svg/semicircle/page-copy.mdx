# Semicircle

A React component that draws an <abbr title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</abbr>
semicircle path at a given percentage.

<SvgArtboardControlled
  diameter={300}
  padding={20}
  percent={0}
/>

## Appearance and Expectations

A retangular box divided into two sections should appear.

The larger section contains a transparent circle outlined with 50 dots equally spaced arond its circumference.

The smaller section contains two linked form controls each of which enable the definition of an integer from zero to one hundred. These control the percentage of the semi-circle that will be drawn on the stage.

Changing the value of either input should result in a pink semicircle being drawn from 12 o'clock to a point representative of the percentage in a clockwise direction.
